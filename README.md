‚ùó**NOTE**: The content related to productivity and stress management on this project is based on my personal interpretation of David Allen's book "Getting Things Done." While I have studied and been inspired by Allen's techniques and he himself has encouraged the creation of this project, I don't have direct affiliation with the author or his work. I recommend users consult the original book for a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies.
